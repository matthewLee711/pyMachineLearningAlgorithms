    "*supervised learning* - learn a model from labeled *training* data that allows us to make predictions about unseen or future data.\n",
    "* supervised refers to a set of samples where the desired output signals (labels) are laready known\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subcategories:\n",
    "\n",
    "*classification task* - Predict the categorical class labels of new instances based on past observations. Those class labels are discrete, unordered values that can be understood as group memberships of the instances. (Assign categorical, unordered labels to instances)\n",
    "    * Ex. binary classification - spam and non spam emails. (Machine learning algo learns set of rules to distinguish two possible classes\n",
    "    * Ex. multi-class classification - handwritten character recognition. (Collect a training dataset taht consists of multiple handwritten examples of each letter in the alphabet.\n",
    "    \n",
    "*regression* - prediction of continuous outcomes. We are given a number of *predictor* (explanatory) variables and a continous response variable(outcome), and we try to find a relationship between those variables taht allow us to predict an outcome.\n",
    "    * Linear regression - Given a predictor variable *x* and response variable *y*, you can fit a straight line to this data\n",

    "*reinfocement learning* - Goal is to develop a system (*agent*) that improves its performance based on interactions with the *environment*. Through the interaction with the environment, learning is achieved through maximizing actions through a reward function.\n",

Each cluster may arise during the analysis define a group of objects... Can be considered \"unsupervised classification\" \n",
